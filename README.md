# üöó AutoShop Database Management System

The **AutoShop Database System** is a relational database designed to manage employees, customers, vehicles, and repair services for an automotive workshop.  
It demonstrates database design, SQL development, and procedural logic through the use of **tables, constraints, stored procedures, and triggers**.

## üß© Overview
This project simulates a real-world car service and repair shop.  
It stores and manages information about customers, cars, mechanics, and scheduled services while enforcing business rules through SQL Server constraints and triggers.
